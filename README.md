## Fork Notice (`dev` branch)

This repository is a **fork** of the original Auto-McGraw project by `GooglyBlox`.
The sections below keep the original usage documentation, and this section tracks fork-specific changes merged into `dev`.

### Changes merged from `pr/deepseek-fix`

- Fixed DeepSeek tab discovery and message routing so both `chat.deepseek.com` and `deepseek.chat` are handled more reliably.
- Improved DeepSeek content script selectors for:
  - assistant response detection
  - chat input detection
  - send button detection
- Improved settings/background detection for DeepSeek availability checks.
- Added `https://chat.deepseek.com/*` to extension host permissions.

### Changes merged from `quizzes`

- Added quiz support for `https://ezto.mheducation.com/*`.
- Added a dedicated quiz automation content script: `content-scripts/ezto-mheducation.js`.
- Updated background tab detection and tab focus logic to work with both:
  - `learning.mheducation.com`
  - `ezto.mheducation.com`
- Updated manifest entries for the new quiz domain/content script and `api.github.com` host access.
- Extension manifest version in this branch is `2.0`.

## Compatibility Notice

**⚠️ MacOS Users:** This extension may not work properly on MacOS due to platform-specific differences in Chrome extension behavior and system interactions. For the best experience, we recommend using this extension on Windows or Linux systems.

## Installation

1. Download the latest zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/GooglyBlox/auto-mcgraw/releases)
2. Extract the zip file to a folder
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extracted folder

## Usage

1. Log into your McGraw Hill account and open a Smartbook assignment
2. Log into one of the supported AI assistants in another tab:
   - [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)
   - [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)
   - [DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com)
3. Click the "Ask [AI Model]" button that appears in your Smartbook header
4. Click "OK" when prompted to begin automation
5. Watch as the extension:
   - Sends questions to your chosen AI assistant
   - Processes the responses
   - Automatically fills in answers
   - Handles multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, and ordering questions
      - **Note about matching questions:** Due to technical limitations, matching questions cannot be automated. When encountering a matching question, the extension will show you AI-suggested matches in an alert. You'll need to manually drag and drop the matches, then the extension will continue with automation.
   - Navigates through forced learning sections when needed

Click "Stop Automation" at any time to pause the process.

## Settings

Click the settings icon ( <img src="assets/settings-icon.svg" alt="Settings Icon" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 16px; height: 16px;"> ) next to the main button to access the settings menu, where you can:

- Choose between **ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, or **DeepSeek** for answering questions
- See the status of your AI assistant connections
- Check if your selected AI assistant is ready to use

The extension will automatically use your selected AI model for all future automation sessions.
